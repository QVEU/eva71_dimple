## Overview

This repository contains two scripts used to process data and generate figures in Bakhache et. al. 2024:

- dms_processing: raw codon counts from mutational scanning experiments and scripts for filtering codon counts based on codons introduced via synthetic biology. 
- alignment_entropy: sequence files and scripts for generating Shannon entropy from curated EV-A71 sequence set and comparing this to mean mutational fitness effect as measured via mutational scanning. 

### Prerequisites
